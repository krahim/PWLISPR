PWLISPR
===========

R code implementing tools from Percival and Walden (1993). This is based on their LISP code, and makes use of the filtering repo which uses FFTW and requires compiling. You can use it without FFTW if you build and make the software in the filtering repository.

This is currently an R package that I do not plan to put on CRAN, and all documentation is in the form of source code comments.
