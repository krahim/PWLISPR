===========

R code implementing tools from Percival and Walden (1993). This is based on their LISP code, and makes use of the filtering repo which uses FFTW and requires compiling. You can use it without FFTW if you comment out the dyn.load command in the R files.

 This is my current working version and there are hard coded path's in some of the R files that will have to be changed. 

I may migrate this to an appropriate R package currently and it is currently a collection of R files.
