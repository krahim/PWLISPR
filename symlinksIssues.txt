filering.R is a symlink to the filtering package.

I use symlinks and I place all the R files in the ~/PWLisp folder
and all the shared objects in the ~/RLibs folder.

I moved the fortran files to filteringFLIB.R and the R only code in filtering.R. There is a boolean switch at the top of the file to specify which function call is used.
